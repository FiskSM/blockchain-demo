            A block is the smallest unit of a block chain.<br/><br/>
            For our example it consists of only 5 elements:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Block number:</strong> The Number of the block in the chain. Integer that
                    starts at 1 and is increased by one for every new block
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Nonce:</strong> A number that is used to make a block valid. Its sole purpose
                    is to be adjusted until the hash of the whole block has certain properties that make it "valid".
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data:</strong> The actual data of the block. Can be anything!</li>
                <li><strong>Previous block hash:</strong> The hash of the previous block. For the first block in a chain an arbitrary value like
                    00000000000... is used
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hash:</strong> The hash of all the previous elements appended together. For our example the hash is calculated with the
                    following code:
                    <pre>CryptoJS.SHA256([blockNumber, nonce, data, prev].join(''))</pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
