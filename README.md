# Blockchain Demo
A web-based demonstration of blockchain concepts.

[Live version](https://guggero.github.io/blockchain-demo/)

This is a heavily modified version of [Anders Brownworth's Blockchain Demo](https://github.com/anders94/blockchain-demo).
Basically only the idea shown in his [excellent Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8) remains,
the code has completely been rewritten. That's why it's not a fork any more but a standalone repository.

Changes in detail:
* Static HTML/JS, so it can be served with GitHub Pages
* Use AngularJS for rendering the page
* Add explanations to most pages
* Expert Mode that shows many details
* Show/implement concept of mining difficulty (in Expert Mode)
* Show duration and speed of mining process (in Expert Mode)
* Toggle between TX/Coinbase and Data view
* [Elliptic Curve Cryptography / Key Pair page](https://guggero.github.io/blockchain-demo/#!/ecc)
* [Bitcoin Block Parser page](https://guggero.github.io/blockchain-demo/#!/bitcoin-block)
